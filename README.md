# Project Overview
This repository contains scripts for modeling longitudinal symptom trajectories and examining baseline correlates and predictive factors in first-episode psychosis.
4 folders:

1. Latent Class & Growth Mixture Modeling – Trajectory identification for depressive and negative symptoms

2. Predictive Modeling – Classification models of trajectory membership using sociodemographic and clinical features

3. Trajectory Comparison and Overlap Analyses – Concordance and divergence between depressive and negative symptom pathways
  
4. Exploratory Correlates Analysis – baseline cognitive performance, longitudinal functional outcomes, and structural brain measures comparisons
